# CF-Handler
This is a simple file made to prevent CatFlipper, a paid Hypixel Skyblock Auction House macro, from timing out and never restarting.

⭐**PLEASE STAR THE REPO TO SHOW GRATITUDE**⭐

Directions:

**To build and run**
- sudo apt update && sudo apt install git
- git clone https://github.com/ProbAlex/CF-Handler
- cd CF-Handler
- chmod +x build.sh
- ./build.sh
- ./catflipper




**If you have Python and just wanna run**
- to download: wget https://github.com/ProbAlex/CF-Handler/releases/latest/download/CF-Handler.py && chmod +x CF-Handler.py
- to run: python3 CF-Handler.py
- to stop: ctrl+c

Note: This script only works on Linux, as I refuse to test Catflipper on my personal computer. If there is a high demand for a Windows port, I will do it at a public library.

Planned:
